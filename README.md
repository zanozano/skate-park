**Version:** 2.0.0

## Description

TrickTrack App is a web application designed to manage skateboarding athletes and handle information related to individuals involved in the skateboarding world. We have utilized technologies such as Handlebars for views, Express for the backend, Bootstrap for the frontend, and PostgreSQL for the database.

The application allows for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on skateboarding athlete records, making it easy to track their progress and achievements. Furthermore, it provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing people's data and their involvement in the skate park.
